entry 1 (july 4th, 2503)  
hello. my name is thea choros. i'm writing this as i spend my next couple of years traveling through space, on my way to the Anomaly.  
the scientists who discovered it said that while it does suck in light like a black hole... it doesn't look like one.  
it's too far away to see the details of it's appearance, that's why me and several of my colleagues are traveling as close as possible to it.  
all we know is that it has a red-ish tint to it with a black center.  
they think that maybe when we get closer, we'll discover the truth of what it really is.  
we are currently going light speed to it's most likely location in the milky way galaxy.  
my best friend ashley is with me too, hopefully she can help me to feel a lot less alone as i separate from the rest of the world for science.  
i hope it goes well.  
  
entry 2 (september 4th, 2503)  
usually i'm not the kind to get incredibly anxious about things.  
but something strange happened today.  
one of my colleagues that watch the Anomaly through the telescope 24/7 noticed that it changed.  
my colleague that saw it wrote that it suddenly flashed bright and morph its shape.  
our radars picked up a low hum that carried it's way through light years of space, to our little ship.  
it came from the Anomaly.  
i've never been so afraid.  
at least ashley believes me.  
  
entry 3 (november 4th, 2503)  
as i was writing the date for this entry, i noticed that my entries are always exactly 2 months apart.  
does it fucking know?  
today i saw the dark space outside my ship change into different colors and i heard.... i don't even know how to describe it.  
screaming? howling? scraping?!  
i told my colleagues what i experienced, but what was strange was that they experienced the same thing, but..  
it was different for every single person.  
one saw everyone's face shift into disgusting creatures, one felt that the ship was shaking violently as they heard someone or something scream into their ear.  
what is happening? why is this happening?  
how?  
i know she's probably trying to cope, but it seems that ashley isn't phased by these things at all. i'm kind of worried about her.  
  
entry 4 (january 4th, 2504)  
[TW: MENTION OF CHILD ABUSE]  
i've grown to be terrified of these days.  
i never know what will happen, or IF anything will happen.  
today.. it's hard for me to write this.  
i'm writing this at 4 am.  
i woke up to a strange voice whispering in my ear.  
it didn't sound human. it sounded like it had two voices speaking in unison.  
it said... awful things.. about what happened to me when i was younger  
i started crying and i just wanted it to end, "please god just stop it, stop it, stop it  
i don't want to remember!"  
and then, i had enough. i went to grab my flashlight and  
see what has been tormenting me for the past hour.  
i saw  
fucking  
nothing.  
i have an awful feeling we should've left it alone.  
i didn't tell her today.  
  
entry 5 (march 4th, 2504)  
I THOUGHT I WASN'T ALONE.  
I THOUGHT WE WERE EXPERIENCING THE TERROR OF THE ANOMALY TOGETHER.  
when i woke up today i saw everyone staring at me.  
not a "you look ridiculous" stare, but a "I WANT TO EAT YOU ALIVE" stare.  
their eyes were bulging out of their sockets.  
they didn't blink. once.  
i ran to the bathroom. i was getting an anxiety attack, i could feel my hands tremble and my heart beating out of my chest.  
i squeezed my eyes shut, and repeated in my head "this isn't happening this isn't happening this isn't happening."  
i did it until i couldn't hear my own heartbeat anymore. until my breathing became quieter.  
and then. i heard breathing that didn't match the rhythm of mine.  
it was coming from the shower, and its curtain was closed.  
the breathing sounded ragged, wheezing.  
slowly i stood up and braced myself for WHAT was behind the curtain.  
and then i realized. ashley wasn't in the main deck at all.  
i pulled the curtain to reveal who i was terrified to see  
it really was HER... she was..  
gored.  
i think she bit off her own hands?? how could human teeth do that?  
how did she not feel that???  
the worst part was that she didn't have eyes... did she eat her own eyes??  
her mouth hung wide open as it something, or herself, forcefully ripped it from the sockets that hold it together in place  
even though she didn't have eye i knew she was staring at me, her ragged breath becoming faster.  
she lunged at me screaming an awful sound, it didn't sound like anything a human could create  
i fought her off the best i could, but she could overpower me easily.  
and then i saw my other colleagues barge into the bathroom, screaming at ashley and trying to get her off of me.  
they're.. back to normal again?!  
and then one of them took a dagger and stabbed her in the chest as i screamed for them to stop!  
that's my best friend!  
  
she wasn't moving anymore.  
i've cried for hours.  
i'm too exhausted to come up with any explanation right now.  
  
entry 5 (may 4th, 2504)  
we disposed of ashley's body by releasing it into space, inside a large bag. hopefully nobody finds it, and most likely they won't.  
i didn't feel anything when they opened the hatch in the back of the ship and let her go. i knew that wasn't really HER, but it was the Anomaly that controlled her.  
that has to be the case, right?  
in other news.  
we've reached it.  
we are approx. 6 million miles away from the event horizon, if it even has one.  
there's this... sort of aura around it, it looks green on the telescope but it looks red to the human eye.  
i swear it looks like there's tentacles coming out of the center and outside the black void of space.  
i didn't tell anyone what i saw but by the looks on their faces i knew they saw something wrong, just like me.  
  
we stopped the ship in place, and one of the assigned colleagues changed into a suit with a large wire attached to the ship.  
i think he was shaking.  
his job was to scan the Anomaly for any extra information about what it's made of, and the frequency of the core.  
he stepped out of the opening, and let the zero-gravity of space drift him closer than any of us have ever reached.  
as he took out his equipment and turned it on, he froze.  
i don't mean like normal people do. it's like somebody pressed pause on him.  
somebody called out to him on the radio. he didn't respond.  
we slowly began to grow frantic as we screamed for him to say something, anything, even to lift his arm.  
  
we tried to figure out what was happening. was there something that the Anomaly was emitting that can cause any matter to just stop?  
somebody said that it could just be that he was trapped in the event horizon, however:  
1. we were MILLIONS of miles away from what could be classified as the event horizon  
2. we learned before this wasn't just a normal black hole, so it could probably be something else entirely.
