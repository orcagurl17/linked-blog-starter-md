this has been veryyy inspired by watching Ducktales and lamenting on how SU could've been if the adult gems in Steven's life were more responsible and appropriate with Steven as he grew up...

like this could be in an alternate universe where Steven, him still getting a normal amount of emotional problems from going on those dangerous adventures and getting into conflicts with Homeworld, so he ends up more well-adjusted and feeling more secure as a person and being able to trust his family. BUT! That's not the point of this AU.

I'm going to give Spinel her very own spin-off series story!!! And this isn't just gonna be the money-laundering AU with Labradorite, Angelite, and others... its supposed to be a full fledged multi-arc thang!!! She meets so many different kinds of gems and other lifeforms(?) and learns more about the gems we already know ;) (idk what the winky is for, just go w it)

notes from my sketchbook:
 - story is jumpstarted by her getting bored at Homeworld, always hanging out with the Diamonds all day every day. She sees something innocuous that reminds her of the gems back on Earth and she gets really curious about what Steven's family of gems are getting up to.
 - her eventually getting to know and interact and bond with other gems outside of the Diamonds (and Steven from a while ago) for once forces her to confront aspects of herself that she's suppressed and dislikes about herself from at her lowest, but these experiences and her forming genuine real friendships with others helps build her self-esteem and worth!
 - There's this BIG plot development (pacing-wise) near the end of the first season/chapter where its discovered that she's the foretold savior in an ancient prophecy of some kind? I havent figured that out yet lawl but its awesome so im gonna dew  . it ðŸ¥¶
 
notes for the laundering group:
- their scheme is fronting as a metaphysical gift shop/woowoo "magick" meditation class
- Labradorite is sorta (i love my autism for this comparison LOL) Louie-adjacent? except she does have a sturdy and calmly-stated sense of inner confidence in herself, and has a healthy, and sort of off-putting to more insecure personalities, detachment from people. Its healthy for her, a sort of thing that others should get used to, to meet her at her level. That all being said, she does has a really good sense of humor and really likes to tease Angelite.
- Angelite plays the shopkeeper, the attendant to all the witchy/hippie customers. She does believe Lab knows what shes doing but she likes to think she has her own better ideas lol. Very Pearl-like mixed with uppity mean girl but shes not that mean.. hard to explain LOL
- The customers are mostly very out-of-touch libral type of people, encapsulates the irony of these magick-believer light witches buying a Moss Agate to connect better with the earth while that stone was mined with slave labor using environment-destroying machinery. The money being laundered is going into actual good change to their local community in New Jersey, to help the locals with affording food and utilities and fixing roads and things like that.)
