**notes**
- Thea's been writing in a diary since she was really little, is a naturally very colorful writer, but is pretty inhibited on the outside.
- Ashley's been her close friend for a long time since they were both young. Lots of inside jokes, been with each other through every hardship and milestone. Dynamic between them both is that Ashley is really reassuring and lighthearted but doesn't really show it when she gets really anxious or emotional, while Thea kinda has... flat affect? Not very expressive, but feels her emotions very strongly and only Ashley can tell when she's feeling anxious and, when prodded, will be blunt about it.
- Thea's parents are largely emotionally absent, but financially supported her to pursue space training and an engineering degree.
- Thea does write pretty bubbly when she's happy and excited, but as the entries continue, her writing becomes more stiff and stilted the more she's on-edge.

Hi Diary! I'm sorry I haven't been writing in you a lot lately, you know usually I can't help myself, but I have been through the wringer in studying and tests lately... but you know it was for a very good reason, as today is my first day on my very first SPACE EXCURSION! I'm technically still in training, but I'll be contributing to a potentially revolutionary scientific discovery. It won't just be me though, as I'm with my colleagues and of course Ashley's here with me too, thank goodness... if not for her I'd be a lot more nervous about all of this. Who else would want to goof around in zero-G with me?
Plus, about the excursion, we're here with a few specialists who are accompanying us. According to our study guide, this is going to be a routine inspection of an ASP (Abnormal Space Phenomena). I know that does sound intimidating at first, but in reality 99% of ASP, if inspected safely and properly, are absolutely harmless. Usually it's just a few molecules interacting together in a way that causes some kind of dimensional imbalance. I'm actually very excited to learn from people IN the field!
I'm actually really grateful that Ashley decided to take her studies seriously just long enough to accompany me to this trip. I know that if she wasn't here, my nerves would eat me alive. Sometimes I just don't really know how to verbalize when I'm feeling really anxious about something, but she always knows somehow! Maybe it's how I fidget with my fingers? She did tease me about that when I was confiding in her about this earlier. Of course just trying to cheer me up, which she's always good at... :-) Okay this entry is getting lengthy, I better go to bed soon as I want to be up early tomorrow. Bye for now!

Hi Diary! It's me again and I have SO much to talk about
