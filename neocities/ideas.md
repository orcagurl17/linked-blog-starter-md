- make a more pleasing menu bar with. maybe buttons?
- menu options:
	about me / diary / guestbook / friends / misc ->drop-down: my stories / AUs / self shipping / other interests
- add left and right side panels to main page (left for important social issue resources, right for webrings)
- add pagination to diary pages (so the page doesn't become stupid long, so like page 1, 2, 3, etc.) but i can just put that when I write a new long ass entry

possible page layout
