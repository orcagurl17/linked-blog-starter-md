 to reset 3d cursor: `SHIFT`+`C`

  checklist:
  - [ ] Finish blocking out the rest of the body with cube w/ subdivision modifier and using mirror modifier as needed (ADD modifiers in object mode!)
	  - I'm going t
  - [ ] Join all shapes together into one object
  - [ ] Tediously (and messily) join vertices of each different shape to the same mesh
  - [ ] Use another subdivison modifier on entire mesh
  - [ ] Use Quad Remesher
