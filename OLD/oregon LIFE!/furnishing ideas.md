1. **ambient lighting** - i want the overhead light in the living room to be on as little as possible. (except for cleaning/reorganizing/Bambi playtime?) some overhead lamps, and maybe if we get a tiny shelf to be put next to the couch or something there'll be a tiny lamp for that too.. and also i wanna use the natural daylight from the window as much as possible too
	1. get curtains for the windows to use when using tv during the day
2. **something nice to see** when immediately walking into the house - a nice wall or shelf decoration on the left of the tv stand area

AIR PURIFIERS!
