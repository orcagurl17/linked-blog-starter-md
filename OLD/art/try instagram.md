i might genuinely consider making a new instagram.. i want to have a sense of community and inspiration from artists i like more directly, get feedback from more people, etc.

I want to avoid doomscrolling though (might be helped if i use a hacked/jailbreaked verson where i can toggle the explore page off, hopefully better home page too)
