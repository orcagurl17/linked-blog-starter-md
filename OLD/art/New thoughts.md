after:
1. sharing those other notes with Jordan, and us having a big important conversation about how they are affected by my frankly coping-with-shitty-circumstances desire for control over something i have had a lot of pride in having Figured Out and that i'm capable and admirable for my art and how i interpret it. It turns out explaining a lot of these things (that i shouldve kept to myself) over wanting to expand the subjects in my art and what i want to be inspired by, reminded them of their baggage with their really shitty catty ex-friend from middle/high school.
2. Getting the big huge insane news that i could move in with Jordan in as little as 3-ish months, because the big house their roommates were looking at is now 99% done with repairs and the estimated soon-as-possible date that they'll both move out is April 1st.

Basically, TLDR:

*"This recent news is really reorienting my priorities so much rn like. I'll be honest a lot of what ive thought of about my reapproach to my art  might be a sort of. trauma response like i felt like things in my life weren't going the pace i wanted, or my family and work was stressing me out, or i was getting wound up about our relationship issues and feeling like I was losing grip on what i KNEW i was good at and what made me feel Useful and Capable. But now its like.. now that very extremely soon i'll be out of this place, the same place i got all of this shitty trauma in the first place, all of these people that have hurt me and who i still want the approval of.. when i really think about it, none of it actually matters and i just ultimately want to be happy with myself and what i already DO. i know when i get settled in (moved in with you) im still gonna have ambitions about the projects i want to do and what i want to try, but... man! I just want to be happy! If right now i need to rest when im not working, if i just doodle fanart and have fun with my friends and with you with my art, then thats okay! Thats really all i need to do! Its such a weight off of my shoulders to realize this and i am in my right mind, you're not taking anything away from me, this actually is helping me feel more human in a way? Like im not a robot just to be A Great Artist or some dumb crap"*
