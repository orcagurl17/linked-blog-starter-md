the Mia in my head when i think of Making Art That Represents my Emotions:
"ermm that makes no sense i dont get it. what is this supposed to mean likeee... it just doesnt flow right lol. Like what does this part even mean i dont get it. Honestly with what youre doing here its like you have too much ideas for where your skill is really at you should be more realistic imo"

and i just abide by it. i cant do anything else because

being surrounded by All of my past files and all of my failed projects and stupid fanart and things related to someone else make me feel so fucking pathetic and stupid and like i can't be motivated by my OWN ideas and excitement, it HAS to be supplemented by someone else caring about it.

I JUST REALIZED ITS THE. THE DIFFERENCE IS:
- CuriousConfusion: ooh woah thats really interesting, but im kind of confused about what xyz means, could you explain it in more detail? But its still really cool for this and that!
- UncuriousConfusion: [THIS!!](#^mia-in-head)
holy shit that took me a minute to learn but this is awesome.
