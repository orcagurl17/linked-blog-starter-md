- eager spunky new hire at the NWR as an intern, aspiring to be an engine driver of her own locomotive one day. moved from the US to Sodor.
- grew up with supportive parents, relatives, teachers, and older coworkers, but has always struggled to socialize and bond with other people her age. has an immense teacher's pet complex about it. has a lot of anxiety around wanting to fit in and convince people that she's capable and "cool-headed" under pressure.

misc. notes
- It WOULD make sense for her to be Midwestern because sunflowers are all OVER the Midwest .. maybe make her a Wisconsin girlie? Give her a motivating sentimental reason to want to drive a special locomotive themed around sunflowers (family?)
