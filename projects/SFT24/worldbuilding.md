	how locomotives are seen in society
In this universe, steam locomotives have a very prominent role in society. They are very highly acclaimed and respected and to aspire to be in the railroading industry is seen the same as wanting to become a doctor or a politician. For example, the United States has widespread reliable cross-country rail transportation for both passenger and freight. Locomotive drivers have something similar to local celebrity status, as well as the locomotives themselves are seen as local OR national symbols.

However, there is an underground movement whose main motivation is making diesel locomotives the main kind of rail transportation. The reasoning is that diesel runs more quickly and efficiently than steam, however this movement is largely unpopular just because steam locomotives have such a cultural influence on almost everyone in the modern era, spanning centuries. Steam has as much familiarity as, for example, the mostly homogenously designed home appliances we all use everyday. (How alienating and unintuitive would it be if the entire layout on a stove or a dishwasher was completely switched up, for instance? If you suddenly had to use appliances that were brightly-colored eye sores, and that used a completely different power source?) However, this diesel movement remains strong as it is mostly run by corporate greed. One particular figure in the movement wants to overthrow the North Western Railway.
