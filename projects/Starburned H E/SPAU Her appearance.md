details that differ from canon
- above drawing is her in a relaxed state, confident, secure
- 2 distinct mascara stripes instead of 3
- dark shiny eyelids
- pigtails are more stout(?) and spiky in bigger chunks
- silhouette is more masculine, wider chest, and smaller hips

it takes a while for her to "grow" into this appearance, at the start of the timeline she resembles her canon appearance the most. however, despite her growing into this more mature form, when in an anxious state she reverts back for the duration of the anxious episode.
