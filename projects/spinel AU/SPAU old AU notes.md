Story: Instead of going with the Diamonds, Spinel decides to go out into the world and start over with somebody. She serendipitously finds a group of gems that all found each other through hardship - abandonment, similar to Spinel herself.

This gem group partakes in money laundering to help the local community, but another particular gem is on their case - Hodgkinsonite. She’s a pink gem who used to be similar to a sheriff on Homeworld, but since Era 3, she’s been continuing her duties on Earth.

This story takes place in New Jersey, a state close to Delmarva (this canonical state is based off of the real life states of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia). The group that Spinel found runs a money laundering scheme, where they front as a beauty parlor.

themes:
- female friendship
- sapphic homoeroticism
- mental health
- attachment theory
- insecurity
- _am i like you/are you like me, or am i all alone?!_

The members of the group:
- Labradorite - the planner
- Frankie, a Hypersphene - the executor
- Angelite - the front
- Mullet, an Amethyst - the guard
- NEWLY: Spinel - the comic relief?
