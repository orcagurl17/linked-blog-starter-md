DUDE ITS BEEN FIVE TRILLIAN YEARS since I was in here.... things have been a bit hard. As in little thangs here and there, mostly with my job, finances, and general CPTSD and BPD stuff. on top of me recently having an issue refilling my meds (tbh it was that I didnt know that my last bottle Was my last refill for the period. oh well)

It is ok, I have done  a lot in adjusting my priorities with my phone. And technology in general stirring from suddenly getting the motivation to download ALL of my music playlists on Youtube, so I can have my music with my locally at ALL. TIMES. !

And now thanks to some YT videos inspiring me, I want to try decentering my phone from being my music, note-taking, and camera and apps device. I want dedicated devices for my needs. I already deleted a buncha apps i didnt need on my phone, I got my Samsung notes on my PC and took it off of my phone, I moved all of my videos and old voice memos to my PC to save space (and also so I can internalize that I should use my physical notepad for notes when out and about. Mostly for that though
