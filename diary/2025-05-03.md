#dumbphone #dedicateddevices #camera #mp3

DUDE ITS BEEN FIVE TRILLIAN YEARS since I was in here.... things have been a bit hard. As in little thangs here and there, mostly with my job, finances, and general CPTSD and BPD stuff. on top of me recently having an issue refilling my meds (tbh it was that I didnt know that my last bottle Was my last refill for the period. oh well)

It is ok, I have done  a lot in adjusting my priorities with my phone. And technology in general stirring from suddenly getting the motivation to download ALL of my music playlists on Youtube, so I can have my music with my locally at ALL. TIMES. !

And now thanks to some YT videos inspiring me, I want to try decentering my phone from being my music, note-taking, and camera and apps device. I want dedicated devices for my needs. I already deleted a buncha apps i didnt need on my phone, I got my Samsung notes on my PC and took it off of my phone, I moved all of my videos and old voice memos to my PC to save space (and also so I can internalize that I should use my physical notepad for notes when out and about. Mostly for that though to be fair).

**I am trying to muse on what my ideal kind of mp3 player would be.... an old iPod sounds nice initially, but I want to see what else is available.**

features I want:
- will last a long time
- simple menu and options
- big display of song art and able to see both song and artist title
- can navigate through my folders
- can make new playlists

**and then here's the device i want to invest in next (since I have a pretty good solution for music rn i dont have to rush this part): a camera !!!!!!!**

I really like the idea of having a separate physical device Just for photos and videos. and also I dont wanna keep having to upkeep the storage issues and organizing the magnitude of my camera roll and how big it eventually gets. If i can just have a seperate camera, and a folder on my PC for all of my saved photos and vids, it would make life so much easier oh my god.

camera of interest: SAMSUNG WB250F

UPDATE: Jordan was able to send me some $ so i can buy that camera off of Ebay!!!! She's such an angel ; __ ; <333333

**not really devices, but related to the functions that my phone has that i want to nearly completely remove: apps!!!!**

there was this video someone made where in it, she explains about this program/website/app??? where you can access all of your different DMs across different social medias all in one place. And i was thinking I could do that with Messenger, Insta, and Bsky. So that I can keep up with family, and my friends sending me stuff on socials that I dont personally go on very much at all. plus I dont rlly want those bookmarked in Firefox tbh.

Im thinking of letting my parents and Nana know that I wont be 24/7 available on Messenger but plz keep msging me! But if its an of absolute urgency to just text my phone number or like more appropriately, call my phone. I do have an infamy of being bad at texting back though but if im niceys sweetsit enough.... scratches my chin...

OH YEAH my main motivations for this endeavor:
- to make computer time more rewarding and intentional
- to help contain my creativity for when i will actually have access to my computer or other art mediums
- to let myself feel fully in the moment even if I have my phone on me

i think the sheer act of consolidating different uses for things to different dedicated devices has a certain... zen about it. a nostalgic je ne sais quoi that harkens to a simpler time. its really nice and the feelsy touchie of holding a notepad, or a camera, or an mp3 player, is unlike anything that a modern phone feels like.

and just completely eliminating all apps as well, even Youtube and games*, will help me a lot w my attention span and sleep habits. as well as being Able to be bored enough to come up with ideas for my various projects and tinkerings even outside of literally Being at Work and dying.

Update: I was able to reorganize my home screen a bit. I'm a little too pussy to delete my YT and Tumblr apps bc I put some effort into getting cracked versions of them .. weehhh. Maybe with this layout I can get used to not defaulting to opening those apps (shrug)
