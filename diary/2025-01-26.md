I'm in my first ever UU sermon right now.. the togetherness feels really nice :') BUT they had a ritual where everybody faced different cardinal directions and i got it wrong LOL. it was cool though i like it, its very, shall i say, universal. which is the point :-)

earth my body
water my blood
fire my body
lift my spirit?

OMG THERES B
