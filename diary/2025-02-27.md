WHYYYY am I so nervous. Bruh

I guess what's been stressing me out lately has been that im fucking broke and have no money. and that ive been missing Jordan a lot because of their work schedule </3 and i think im trying to feel a sense of control and worthiness from wanting to start some new ambitious projects that I AM genuinely wanting to do, but i think i need help in figuring out how to regulate
