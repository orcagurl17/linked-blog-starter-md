WHYYYY am I so nervous. Bruh

I guess what's been stressing me out lately has been that im fucking broke and have no money. and that ive been missing Jordan a lot because of their work schedule </3 and i think im trying to feel a sense of control and worthiness from wanting to start some new ambitious projects that I AM genuinely wanting to do, but i think i need help in figuring out how to regulate my poor self-esteem feelings so I can be more clearheaded about my genuine wants.

ALSO:
- I was a bit half-hearted with virtually attending the UU service and the pastor lady has been rubbing me the wrong way but I really like everything else, and I do want to go in-person next week. Am nervous about that.
- I have been considering making my therapy sessions every 2 weeks instead of once every week, it feels like not a lot happens in a week?? and plus it could give me more time to get my thoughts together and stuff before a session?

- apply for food stamps
