i have therapy today, i'm having trouble remembering what to bring up
ok I said that but I have some ideas

- while i do appreciate her wanting to do some fun activities w my friends and my partner (former being taking that love languages test, and the latter being taking a walk with him), I do think that there's other issues that i want to touch on first before my therapist can have a better idea of how my friends are like.
- the topics i wanna touch on relate to my baggage with making friends In Real Life. i think i have to explain to her my situation with that, how it has been really hard to make and keep friends offline, but it has always been easier for me to bond with people online from our shared interests and this is how i met my partner and friends and why
