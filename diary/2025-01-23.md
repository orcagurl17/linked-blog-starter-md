trying this out for the first time... idk how i'm gonna use this yet but we'll see (shrug)

OK . OK . OK LORD. JESUS . i'll elaborate later 😁💪

UPDATE. so that guy Ben was like "i thought u just ignored me" and IT WAS JUST THAT i misread the number he gave me.... it was nobody on the other end :ough: No little worries.... i txted him for realsies this time so all is well 😇

also i THINKK i get the right idea about how to use Obsidian with tags and links, which helps organize better than folders. And u can use the graph view to see how all of your notes/ideas connect even in ways you arent aware of yet, which is SICK. i was also able to fix my syncing issue which. idk what that was about but i know how to fix it next time! :D

also LMAO at Ben being my first "person" tag on here.... i mean. 🏅 for that 🫶
