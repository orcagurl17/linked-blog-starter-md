I have a therapist appt. today and I'm feeling. Pretty insecure. I feel like even though I DID do some new things this week, I still feel like it is underwhelming and dissapointing. I know she wanted me to do a group gathering this week but I could only manage to go to the Sunday service through a Zoom call. I didn't interact with anyone. But i still believe that was a good first step for me to understand the vibe of everything
