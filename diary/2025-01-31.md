I have a therapist appt. today and I'm feeling. Pretty insecure. I feel like even though I DID do some new things this week, I still feel like it is underwhelming and dissapointing. I know she wanted me to do a group gathering this week but I could only manage to go to the Sunday service through a Zoom call. I didn't interact with anyone. But i still believe that was a good first step for me to understand the vibe of everything. I think I'm going to have pretty slow progress for a while but it IS progress. I really want to try to do SOMETHING lovely next week... I do have some ideas.
- Me and Jordan would love to go on a walk thru the park this weekend
- If I have Sunday morning available, I'd wanna attend a service in person if I feel up to it
- If there's a group event at the church that sounds nice, I'd like to attend

PLUS I was able to text Ben, and while he wasn't able to reply thru text, he DID when he saw me at work which is reassuring! I feel better knowing that my attempts to believe in a more charitable light is paying off. I got to see pics of him and his GF visiting this huge-ass fork in the middle of a field which I had no idea even existed LOL. I should find a pic of it and show my therapist
